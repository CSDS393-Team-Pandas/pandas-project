# ej2-documenteditor

The [JavaScript Document Editor](https://www.syncfusion.com/javascript-ui-controls/js-word-processor/?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=javascript-word-processor-npm) component is used to create, edit, view, and print Word documents in web applications. All the user interactions and editing operations that run purely in the client-side provides much faster editing experience to the users.

An example [Word Processor server-side Web API projects for ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, and Java is available in GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/EJ2-DocumentEditor-WebServices?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=javascript-word-processor-npm) which contains all the mandatory Web APIs for opening Word documents, paste with formatting, restrict editing, spell-checking, and saving documents.

Syncfusion provides a predefined [Word Processor server docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/syncfusion/word-processor-server?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=javascript-word-processor-npm) targeting ASP.NET Core 2.1 framework. You can directly pull this docker image and deploy it in server on the go. You can also create own docker image by customizing the existing [docker project from GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/Word-Processor-Server-Docker?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=javascript-word-processor-npm).
